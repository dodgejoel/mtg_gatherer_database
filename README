This bundle of code is designed to scrape Wizards of the Coast's Magic: the
Gathering card database at 'http://gatherer.wizards.com' and build a SQLite
database with all of the card information contained in it.  First run initialize_databse.py 
to create the database with the appropriate tables.  Next run gather_card_data.py
to extract all of the data.  This takes a while because each cards page has
to be opened up one at a time.  Finally run input_to_database.py to input
the gathered data into the database.

I have not thought much yet about what will happen if this process is
interrupted and you attempt to begin it again.  Working through this will probably
also solve the problem of how to update the database when new cards are released.
This will be for the near future!

Non built-in modules required are: bs4, sqlite3.
