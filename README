This bundle of code is designed to scrape Wizards of the Coast's Magic: the
Gathering card database at 'http://gatherer.wizards.com' and build a SQLite
database with all of the card information contained in it.  There are a couple
of places in the code where it is assumed that some prior set up has occurred
like the existence of an SQL database with certain tables that have certain
columns or the existence of a folder at some specified path.  I will be adding
to this repository so that these things are included in the code and this
package will be come more self-contained. 

Non built-in modules required are: bs4, sqlite3.
