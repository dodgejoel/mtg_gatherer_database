This bundle of code is designed to scrape Wizards of the Coast's Magic: the
Gathering website at 'http://gatherer.wizards.com' and build a SQLite database
called mtg_gatherer.db with all of the card information contained in it.  First
run initialize_database.py to create the database with the appropriate tables.
Next run gather_card_data.py to extract all of the data.  This takes a while
because each cards page has to be opened up one at a time.  Finally run
input_to_database.py to input the gathered data into the database.  

I have not thought much yet about what will happen if this process is
interrupted and you attempt to begin it again.  Working through this will
probably also solve the problem of how to update the database when new cards
are released.  This will be addressed soon.  I would also like to bundle this all into a single script that, when called once, will execute all three parts of this program without further user interaction.  After these two bits of the project are completed I would like to implement a GUI for interacting with the database.  In essence I would like to recreate locally all of the functionality of the original website.   

Non built-in modules required are: bs4, sqlite3.
